# Elevator Demand Density Control

## Introduction
This project aims to optimize the elevator traffic of a shopping mall by using multithreading. The main goal of the project is to minimize the waiting time for the customers by balancing the elevators' loads in the mall.

## Technology Stack
The project was developed using Java programming language and multi-threading techniques. The user interface of the project was created using Java Swing.

## How it Works
The project works by constantly monitoring the demand density of each floor of the shopping mall. Based on the demand density, the elevators are assigned to specific floors to minimize the waiting time for the customers.

The project utilizes multithreading techniques to achieve this optimization. The main thread monitors the demand density and assigns the elevators to floors, while the other threads simulate the elevators moving between floors.

## Conclusion
Elevator Demand Density Control is a Java-based project that leverages multi-threading techniques to optimize the elevator traffic of a shopping mall. The project minimizes the waiting time for the customers by balancing the elevators' loads in the mall. The user interface of the project was created using Java Swing.
